# Sound-and-Responses-to-Robot-Failure

This repository showcases video stimuli further explained in the accepted ICRA 2025 paper entitled "How Sound-Based Robot Communication Impacts Perceptions of Robotic Failure."

## Stimulus Condition Videos

This work centered on an online video-based survey that explored how different Hello Robot Stretch RE2 sound profiles impacted onlooker reactions to robot failure. In this work, the three presented sound conditions were: 
1) A robot with no added sound (i.e., consequential sound only, such as sound from the robot's actuators and interactions with objects in the environment)
2) A robot with added linguistic sound (i.e., verbal speech)
3) A robot with added character-like sound (i.e., functional and emotional sound that was non-linguistic)

For each condition, we presented an initial stimulus video introducing the robot in the corresponding sound case. As further described in the paper, we administered a brief set of survey questions after this initial stimulus video. Then, we showed a video of the robot failing in the designated sound case (i.e., the failure stimulus video), followed by another brief set of survey questions.

The introduction and failure videos for each condition are presented below.

## Stretch Robot Introduction

Because we expected most respondents to be unfamiliar with the Stretch robot, we also made a brief video that we asked participants to view near the beginning of the survey (before viewing any condition stimuli). That video is also included below.
